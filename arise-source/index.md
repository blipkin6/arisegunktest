Simply fork [Arise on Github](https://github.com/spectrasecure/arise), edit your site, and point your cloud vendor to your repository. The included CI workflow does all the hard work of building and deploying your site straight from the cloud.

## Practical pages for real-world use

Most projects like this are one-off tech demos. While many of them "work", they often lack critical CMS-style features that are important for actually organising stuff on your website. Real websites don't have just one page, but rather are built on top of hierarchies of linked pages. 

Arise solves this problem by building websites that are designed to be modular, hierarchical, and traversable. Arise supports the creation of dynamic index pages based on individual page metadataâ€” just tell Arise where you need an index, and it will build it for you all on its own.

For an example of what index pages created by Arise look like, check out the [Sample Posts](posts) on this website.
